# Sort Analyzer

This project visualizes various sorting algorithms using Python and Matplotlib. The visualizations help in understanding how each sorting algorithm operates and how data elements move into their sorted positions over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Visualization**: Watch how different sorting algorithms sort an array of numbers step by step.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms**: Choose from several sorting algorithms to see their behavior.
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- **Real-time Updates**: The visualization updates in real-time to show the progress of the sorting algorithm.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Bubble Sort
A simple comparison-based sorting algorithm where each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.

### Selection Sort
An in-place comparison-based algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted.

### Insertion Sort
A simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.

### Merge Sort
An efficient, stable, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. Most implementations produce a stable sort, meaning that the order of equal elements is the same in the input and output.

### Quick Sort
An efficient, comparison-based, divide and conquer sorting algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
